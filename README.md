# Pong

This is the repository I've created as an experiment for using github
There are two branches initially:
  1. Main
  2. Master
  
Main is unprotected and is the default code unedited as from the tutorial I've created pong from
Master has few comments changed as of Jan 26th.

More changes are expected to be added to the master branch
