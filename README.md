# Pong

This is the repository I've created as an experiment for using github
There are two branches initially:
  1. master
  2. test 1
  
master is unprotected and is the default code unedited as from the tutorial I've created pong from tutorial
master is the pure unedited code

testing is done on branch created called test 1.
Added 2 comments on 26/01/23 to test 1
